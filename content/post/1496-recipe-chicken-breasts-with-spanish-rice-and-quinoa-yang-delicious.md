##### Steps to make Chicken Breasts with Spanish Rice and Quinoa:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

I know we already discussed this, but I must say it again. Most restaurant fried rice is overpriced, underwhelming, and sorely lacking in tasty mix-ins like vegetables, eggs, and chicken or shrimp. I&#39;m forever tempted to order it based on potential alone, but it lets me down every single time. In a large skillet over medium heat prepare rice according to package directions, using the butter/margarine to brown the vermicelli and rice to a golden brown. Add the water, chicken, salsa and tomatoes and bring all to a boil.
