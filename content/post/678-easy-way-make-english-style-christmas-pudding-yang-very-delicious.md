Unlike American puddings, a Christmas pudding is a dark, sticky, and dense sponge, more like a fruitcake, made of mixed dried fruit, candied fruit peel, apple, and citrus zests. Brandy and spices provide a deep, complex flavor and signature dark color. All three of these names refer to a traditional English steamed cake-like dessert comprised of breadcrumbs, flour, suet, sugar, eggs, brandy, lemon zest, candied citrus peel, spices, and dried fruits (specifically raisins, currants, and golden raisins). Christmas pudding is often served on fire (en flambe - using brandy, rum, or whiskey), with a sauce (toffee, butterscotch, or creme Anglaise), topped with royal icing, or simply dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar as shown here.
