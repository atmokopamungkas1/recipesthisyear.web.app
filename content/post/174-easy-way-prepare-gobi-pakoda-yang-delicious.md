Growing up we enjoyed a variety of pakora&#39;s. I use a fairly basic mix of seasonings to punch up the flavour in this gobi pakora, as a base recipe: Fresh cilantro (coriander) Ginger Garlic Paste Curry Powder Carom Seeds Coriander Powder Cayenne Pepper. But I tend to see pakora batter as a free-form thing, and will add other seasonings depending on what I&#39;m feeling like at the time. Combine the besan, coriander, rice flour, ginger garlic paste, chilli powder, turmeric powder, asafoetida, garam masala, carom seeds, cumin seeds powder, chaat masala and salt in a deep bowl.
