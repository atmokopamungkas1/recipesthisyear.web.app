Hey everyone, it is John, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, fluffy hot cross buns. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

A small amount of flour and liquid are cooked on a stove to make a runny paste. As the liquid heats up, the flour absorbs the hot liquid, creating expanded starch molecules and gluten structures. This is then mixed with the rest of the ingredients. This hybrid roll is an incredibly light and fluffy dinner roll but is lightly sweetened, filled with fragrant spices and currants, topped with a cross, and (optional) finished with a shiny glaze.
