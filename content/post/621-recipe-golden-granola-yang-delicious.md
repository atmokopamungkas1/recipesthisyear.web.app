##### Instructions to make Golden Granola:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Whisk maple syrup, vegetable oil, dark. A wonderful crunchy granola full of all things yummy and good. Unrefined Oil Oil helps make this granola crisp and irresistible. I prefer unrefined coconut oil, which is delicious (you can barely taste the coconut, if at all) and produces the perfect texture. You can use extra-virgin olive oil instead, if you&#39;d like your granola to be a little more on the savory side.
