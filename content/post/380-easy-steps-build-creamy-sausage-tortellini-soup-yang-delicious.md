Transfer to serving bowls and add a pinch of red pepper flakes. You can cut up some links if you&#39;d like, but I picked up ground spicy Italian sausage and just sauteed that. (If you like spicy sausage, I highly recommend using that in this soup! Otherwise, mild sausage also works just as well.) Ingredients Italian Sausage - try mild Italian sausage or a spicy sausage to add some heat Garlic - add the garlic to taste, but use fresh garlic versus garlic powder Onion - we prefer yellow onion for caramelized sweet flavor but you can use white or red onion instead. Salt - add salt to taste since sausage is naturally fairly salty Creamy Sausage Tortellini Soup is a quick, comforting one pot dinner.
