1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Store-bought dumpling skins are easiest, and actually standard in Japanese-style gyoza. Draining cabbage and wringing it out in a towel removes water, intensifies flavor, and prevents the filling from getting soggy. Spreading the filling on the wrapper in a disk shape, instead of a tiny ball of filling, helps prevent dumplings from bursting open. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil. Serve the dipping sauce with the warm dumplings.
