1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Katsu Curry is a popular Japanese curry served with sticky Japanese rice and topped with a crispy breaded cutlet called &#34;katsu&#34;. Katsu is most commonly made with pork chops in Japan (similar to a pork schnitzel) but can also be chicken or even beef. Pork Katsu (Tonkatsu) is my favorite Japanese dish of all time; I am confident that you will LOVE this recipe because I am extra picky when it comes to fried pork chops. I am using a batter today; this will help ensure that the panko stays on, but it will also help protect the meat to ensure it is juicy on the inside while crispy on the outside. I also like using a batter to prevent the skin.
