Chef&#39;s Tips The key to a good crusted chicken Romano is to make sure the chicken cutlets are really thin. If you leave the chicken breasts whole, they&#39;ll take too long to cook all the way through, and they won&#39;t resemble the Cheesecake Factory dish. Don&#39;t put any of the breading layers on too thick, or your crust won&#39;t be even and really crispy. If you can&#39;t find thinly cut chicken breasts in the grocery store you could also slice regular sized chicken breasts in half to make them thinner.

Pan fry the chicken in batches using a big skillet and some olive oil under they are golden brown on both sides. Ingredients Chicken breast - big fat ones work the best. Panko breadcrumbs - I like panko better than traditional breadcrumbs because it provides a bit more crunch.
