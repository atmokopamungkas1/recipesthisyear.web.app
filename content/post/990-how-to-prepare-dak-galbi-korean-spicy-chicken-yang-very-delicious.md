Spicy sauce is topped over the chicken and vegetable and stir-fried, often on the dinner table. You wrap it up in lettuce leaves together with some nori and kimchi (a bit like san choy bow) to make little handheld bundles of sweet, fiery and savoury goodness. Dakgalbi (Korean Spicy Chuncheon Chicken Stir Fry) is a famous chicken dish that has origins in the city of Chuncheon-a city east of Seoul near the Chuncheon Dam. For the marinade: Gochujang / Korean Hot Pepper Paste - One of the key flavours in Korean cuisine. While it is spicy, it has more of a well-rounded, sweet tomato flavour rather than just pure chilli heat. (Note: You can buy an extra hot version if you want!).
